# Open Information Extraction Demo

This is the main demo for demonstrating Open Information Extraction (Open IE).
It relies on an extractor to be run over a large corpus (such as ClueWeb) and
indexed in to SOLR.  This code provides a search interface on top of the SOLR
index.  The Open IE demo has gradually been shifting from a database of our
Open IE triples to a question-answering system.
